# Idea implementation in the forked website :

1. Increase graphic views 
Main Focus 
2. CREATING A Embedded System game for my website. 


## Embedded System game ideas :

> 1. We are gonna **change game memory game pictures** with Embedded System logic pictures. 
> 2. **Matching the logics of embedded system wins the game point !**

     for logic example : 
       I2C - 2 way communication 
       udp/tcp - Internet protocols
       Soc- System on chips
       
> 3. After changes, **game will be merged/or linked to the embedded system developer repositories**.
